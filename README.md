* This was the third and final project that I finished this week. This was a great confidence-building activity for me. I was struggling initially finding ways to create the program. The beginning loop was difficukt whether I should've picked a for loop or while loop. This was one of the most challenging part. I was also struggling with the comprehension and making sure every line of code was accessible  within the loop. I enjoyed coding this and loved the product I built,  I am eager to build more and develop bigger and better games.
